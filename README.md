# Brief Description
Smart Library is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain
all the daily work of library.This project has many features which are generally not available
in normal library management systems like facility of recommendation system in that user
can see most of the recommended books which help the to choose good books for better
understanding, user login and teacherâ€™s login.
In that we build mobile application i.e. QR code with the help of Iconic framework. Ionic
framework comes under hybrid application ,in hybrid Write one time code and build it on
all platform like window, android and ios. Ionic framework developed by GOOGLE. So, its
one the most popular framework for designing hybrid app.
We have used both web as well as mobile application,mobile application for scanning the
code available on book which is come under ionic framework it is possible to significantly
reduce the financial costs of application development and make application compatible with
98 percent of mobile devices users.
It also has a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system.It has also a facility where student after logging in their accounts can see list of books
issued and its issue date and return date and also the students can request the librarian to
add new books by filling the book request form.Our system also notifies the student when
he/she logins into his/her profile if he/she has not returned a particular book.The system
also charges a student certain charges if they have not returned their books.We have a unique
identification for each book which would reduce the queue in the library .This will be implemented with the help of QR code.The librarian after logging into his account i.e admin
account can generate various reports such as student report,issue report,teacher report and
book report. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as
staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human
efforts.
